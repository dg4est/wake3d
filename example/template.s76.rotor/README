# ============================ #
# 1. Set Solver Symbolic Links #
# ============================ #
Inside of the symlibs directors, symbolically link or copy your shared object
solver libraries that you have compiled in your local directory.

The input file for cdriver is already set up to point to the libraries inside
the symlibs directory.

# ============================ #
# 2. Simulation Initialization #
# ============================ #
To setup the simulation to start from time step 0, run `./setup_initial.sh`.

To verify that everything is setup correctly for starting the simulation:
  a. Check each group directory if the symbolic links point to the *.initial files.
  b. Check each solver's input file for the restart flags to be 0 or 0.0.
  c. Check restart_count.txt contains the number 0 only.
  d. Check input.driver has restart_counter: 0000000.

# ===================== #
# 3. Simulation Restart #
# ===================== #
Run `./setup_restart.sh'.

This script will do the following procedures:
  a. Move WRK directories in each group directory to the next restart_count.txt index.
  b. Update restart_count.txt index automatically.
  c. Reset the sympolic pointers in each group directory to point to the *.restart files.
  d. Update the restart file input file indexes by scanning the checkpoint directories 
     for the last checkpoint file.

# Warning #
NOTE: Do NOT run ./setup_restart.sh back-to-back immediately without running the simulation --
      This can break the indexes set in each of the solver input files, thus the user will 
      need to manually update each file to get it to a correct state.
      Also, you will need to also fix restart_count.txt manually to your last successful
      run count id.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How To Fix Broken Input File #
Go into the WRK# or WRK#/checkpoint/ directory and check the file index you want to restart.
Manually update the input files (input.dg4est.v2/input.nsu3d) to have the correct file path
for the restart file.

Restart Path Name Locations:
group0: input.dg4est.v2 -- line 34 (e.g restart_file: WRK0/checkpoint/soln_0000000.bin)
group1: input.nsu3d -- line 4 (e.g. WRK0/restart.000000)
group2: input.nsu3d -- line 4 (e.g. WRK0/restart.000000)
